# Genetic-Algorithm
We will explore the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in optimization and search problems

### genetic-algorithm.ipynb
This file introduces the notion and characteristics of the GA as well as providing a Python implementation of GA which predicts words and small sentences without performing an exhaustive search. 

### Stadium
The Stadium sub-folder contains implementations of various enviroments where agents can use the GA to further improve themselves overtime. As of now enviroments implemented are simulations of popular games such as:
  - Flappy Bird
